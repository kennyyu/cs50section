(1) In bst.c, fill out the stubs for those functions. Test your functions by
    uncommenting the code in main. Compile with 'make' and run the 'bst'
    executable. [solutions for this will be posted after section]


Because you must implement your own data structures for this week,
I will not post the solutions to linkedlist.c. I have, however, left the
stubs and the pseudocode for it to help you implement it. If your implementation works,
then running 'run' should output the correct stuff and the right behavior
for stacks and queues. 

(2) Implement make_node [solutions posted after section]
(3) Implement free_list [solutions posted after section]
(4) finish insert, remove, get_first, and get_nth [solutions posted next week---]
(5) finish the queue operations, using the stack operations only. [solutions will be posted after section]
